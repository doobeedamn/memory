## Summary
Test and train your memory skills with this simple browser-based game.

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match! Keep track of progress in the score panel area by viewing the star rating, number of moves, and time.

Each turn:
- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
- If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
- Once completion of the game, a information will pop up which contain the time it tooks for completion, the star rating(1-3 stars), and the time it took to complete the game.
- The user may click the "Play Again" button if they want to play again.
- All cards are randomized for each game.
